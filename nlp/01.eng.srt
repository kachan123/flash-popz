What?
Two death's heads again?

18
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:14,802
Hah! I win.
Don't hold it against me.

19
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,306
Hey Ryuk... Do you wanna join us?

20
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,642
Join us, for once.

21
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,813
No, I'm okay.

22
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,740
I didn't do anything
but he still got upset...

23
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:36,991
Really? And then?

24
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,160
What's the matter, Yagami?

00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,121
Please translate the sentence.

26
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,920
Follow the teachings of God.

27
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,757
Then the blessings of the sea
will become bountiful...

No way! You went to see that?

44
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,067
It was such a waste of time.
I shoulda' asked for a refund!

45
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,694
Well, you did watch it...

00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,042

<i>Seriously. . .
s0mething's the matter with me.</i>

55
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,527
<i>This note will not take effect
unless the writer</i>

56
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,238
<i>has the person's face in their mind
when writing his/her name. Therefore...</i>

57
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:24,242
<i>People sharing
the same name will not be affected.</i>

58
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,161
<i>If the cause of death is written</i>

59
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,580
<i>within 40 human seconds

60
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,082

61

<i>If the cause of death
is not specified,</i>

62

<i>the person will simply die
of a heart attack.</i>

63
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,629
<i>After writing the cause of death,</i>

64
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,215

<i>in the next 6 minutes

66
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:46,848
So you can let people die
peacefully or make them suffer.

67
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,893
A prank this intricate
isn't too bad, I guess.

68
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,778
Write in their name and they die, huh...

69
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,614
This is so stupid!

70
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:20,882
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

71
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,135
<i>If someone actually dies,
does that make me a murderer?</i>

72
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:29,307
<i>No way. That's impossible.</i>

at the moment.</i>

83

<i>You can't help but be worried

88
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:15,561
<i>Well, I'm hoping for
a quick resolution to this.</i>

89
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,856
<i>Oh well, nothing happened.</i>

90
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,609
<i>What did I expect?</i>

91
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,487
<i>Just a minute...</i>

92
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,322
<i>There seems to be
something happening.</i>

93
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,240
<i>The hostages are coming out!</i>

94
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,825
<i>They all seem to be all right!</i>

95
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,411
<i>And now it looks like
the SWAT team is entering!</i>

96
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,955
<i>Has the suspect been arrested?!</i>

97
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,165
<i>Yes!</i>

98
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,833
<i>We just received word</i>

99
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,294
<i>that the suspect has died
inside the daycare center!</i>

100
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,338
<i>The suspect is dead!</i>

101
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:43,965
Dead?!

102
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,967
KUROU OTOHARADA

103
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,261
<i>The police are strongly denying
that they shot the suspect!</i>

104
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,432
<i>Could he have felt cornered...
and committed suicide?</i>

105
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,603
<i>According to one of the hostages,
"the suspect suddenly collapsed. "</i>

106
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,021
<i>A heart attack...</i>

107
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,317
<i>N-No way...</i>

108
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,862
<i>This is a coincidence.
It's gotta be coincidence!</i>

109
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,614
Light!

110
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:13,786
It's almost 6:30. Don't you have
your prep course tonight?

111
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,414
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

112
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,874
<i>Death Note...</i>

113
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,711
<i>But if this really works...</i>

114
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,922
<i>It's worth testing it out once more.</i>

115
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,509
<i>So I guess it will have
to be another criminal.</i>

116
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,220
<i>But it can't be someone
too famous.</i>

117
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:35,808
<i>If he dies, it's possible news
of it will be covered up.</i>

118
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,977
<i>I need an immediate result.</i>

119
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,438
Hey, Ryo baby!

120
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,398
W-What is it, Sudou?

121
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,734
Lend me some money...
2000 yen will do.

122
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,902
W-What? Again?

123
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:47,987
<i>Sudou...</i>

124
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,530
<i>- Shall I kill him?
- What'? You refusmg'?</i>

125
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,160
<i>No, I'd better avoid
people around me.</i>

126
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,581
<i>No... Why should I worry?</i>

127
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:04,086
<i>No one would care if one or
two people like him died.</i>

128
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,173
Now we can go to
the arcade after school.

129
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,760
Maki, wanna party with
some guys tomorrow?

130
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,053
Absolutely!

131
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,262
Hey, me too!

132
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,681
Damn it, Mom!

133
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,100
She's not here to pick me up!

134
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,480
<i>Damn it... It's sickening.
Every single one of them...</i>

135
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:26,609
<i>I'd do society a favor
by killing them.</i>

136
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,987
Hey girl!

137
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,657
Wanna come and play with us?

138
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,619
Hey Taku!
You've got a beauty there!

139
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,121
I'm Takuo Shibuimaru.

140
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,664
Shibutaku, for short.

141
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,585
C'mon and join me...pretty girl.

142
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,295
I don't think so.

143
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,463
She doesn't think so!

144
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:49,507
She's so cute!

145
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,430
C'mon, grab her...
get those clothes off!

146
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,932
You sure?

147
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,434
S-Stop. . .!

148
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,061
Please!

149
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,813
Stop!

150
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,692
TAKUO SHIBUIMARU
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

151
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,070
<i>Now let's see...
What'll happen!</i>

152
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,157
Hey wait!

153
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,534
Taku! Watch out!

154
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,042
<i>This... This proves it!</i>

155
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,295
<i>The Death Note is real!</i>

156
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,047
Taku!

157
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,549
L-Idiot!

158
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,592
He just jumped out in front of me.

159
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,347
Now then...

160
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,224
I'd better get going.

161
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,739
It's been five days...since...

162
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,741
All right...

163
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,285
I'd better get going...

164
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,121
Huh? You going out, Ryuk?

165
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,166
This place is barren...
everywhere you go.

166
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,295
I dropped my Death Note.

167
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,382
You really messed up big time!

168
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,428
Hey, weren't you carrying around
a second one behind the old man's back?

169
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,471
You saying you lost both?

170
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,474
And do you know
where you dropped it?

171
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,351
The Human World.

172
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,519
- What?!
- What?

173
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:56,926
Welcome home.

174
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,719
You're early, Light.

175
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,346
Yeah.

176
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,723
I'm back, Mom.

177
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,520
Oh... The results of the national
practice entrance exams?

178
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,772
Hurry!

179
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:11,982
Here.

180
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,360
Goodness! Number one again!

181
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,403
You really did your best, Light!

182
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,780
Well yeah.

183
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,282
I'll be studying,
so don't interrupt me.

184
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,742
All right.

185
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:25,120
Oh Light...
Do you want anything?

186
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,914
Anything at all?

187
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,124
Not really, Mom.

188
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,213
<i>I already have what I want...</i>

189
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,025
You seem to like it.

190
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,660
Why so shocked?

191
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,998
I'm Ryuk, the Shinigami,
who dropped that notebook.

192
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,166
From what I just saw...

193
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,170
You're already aware that
it's no ordinary notebook.

194
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,761
A Shinigami...huh.

195
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,351
I'm not shocked, Ryuk.

196
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,356
In fact...
I've been waiting for you, Ryuk.

197
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:36,358
Oh?

198
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:41,739
I didn't think
a Shinigami's Notebook was real...

199
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:47,202
but after seeing its results,
I can act with certainty.

200
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:51,915
I see.
You've really surprised me...

201
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:58,380
I've heard of Death Notes getting down
to the Human World a few times before.

202
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,634
But you're the first one to use it
to this extent in just five days.

203
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,137
Most people would be
too scared to try it out.

204
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,765
I'm prepared, Ryuk.

205
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,310
I used the Death Note knowing
it belonged to a Shinigami.

206
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,145
And now the Shinigami's here.

207
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,230
So what'll happen to me?

208
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,982
Are you going to take my soul?

209
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,610
Huh? What's that about?

210
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,279
Is it some fantasy you humans
came up with?

211
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,657
I'm not going to do
anything to you.

212
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,453
Once the Death Note lands
in the Human World,

213
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,705
it belongs to the Human World.

214
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,084
In other words, that belongs to you.

215
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,419
It belongs to. . .me?

216
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,255
If you don't want it,
give it to some other human.

217
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,132
But if you do that,

218
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:45,052
all memory of the Death Note
will be erased from your mind.

219
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,099
So there isn't a price
for using the Death Note?

220
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,768
Well, if anything,
there's...

221
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,939
only the fear and pain humans who have
used the Death Note will experience.

222
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,983
And when you die...

223
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,947
I'll be the one to write
your name on my Death Note.

224
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,617
Don't think for a moment,
that any human...

225
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,787
who's used the Death Note
can go to Heaven or Hell.

226
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,456
That's all.

227
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,797
You'll find out about it
after you die.

228
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,969
Light...

229
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,387
Don't worry.

230
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,638
Go ahead.

231
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,183
What?

232
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,645
I brought some apples,
they're from our neighbor.

233
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,022
Why is it so dark in here?

234
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,649
You'll ruin your eyesight!

235
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,733
<i>What's going on?</i>

236
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:44,027
<i>Mom can't see him?</i>

237
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,366
That notebook...
originally belonged to me.

238
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:55,080
And since you're the one using it,
you're the only one who can see me...

239
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,457
and of course, only you...

240
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,000
Can hear my voice.

241
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,960
In other words,
the Death Note is a bond

242
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,130
between Light the human
and Ryuk the Shinigami.

243
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,135
Tasty.

244
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,304
Let me ask you one more thing.

245
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,514
Why did you choose me?

246
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,392
Hey, are you listening?

247
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,315
Hmm...apples in the
Human World are awesome.

248
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,693
What would you call them? Juicy?

249
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,278
Answer my question.

250
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,822
I didn't choose you.

251
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,450
I just dropped the notebook.

252
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,870
Did you think you were "chosen"
because you were smart?

253
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,205
Don't flatter yourself.

254
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,751
It just happened to fall around here...
and you just happened to pick it up.

255
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,211
That's all.

256
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,047
That's why I wrote the explanation
in English,

257
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,382
the most popular language
in the Human World.

258
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,218
Then why did you drop it?!

259
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,595
Don't tell me it was by mistake

260
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,014
after you went to the trouble and
wrote all those instructions.

261
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,266
Why'd I drop it?

262
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,685
...because I was bored.

263
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,313
Bored?

264
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,151
In fact, Shinigami these days
have so much time on their hands.

265
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,612
They're either taking a nap
or gambling.

266
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,616
If others see you studiously
scribbling names in the Death Note,

267
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,577
they'll say, "what are you working
so hard for?" and laugh at you.

268
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,498
Writing the names of other Shinigami
doesn't work.

269
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,251
But since we live
in the Shinigami Realm,

270
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,754
it's no fun at all to kill people
who live in the Human World!

271
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,259
So I figured it would be more fun
to come down here myself.

272
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,806
But you sure wrote a lotta names.

273
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,975
But Why'd you write down
the cause of death

274
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,435
only for that guy who
was hit by the truck?

275
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,938
Without the cause of
death written down,

276
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,439
they all die of heart attacks.

277
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,110
That's the best thing about
the Death Note, Ryuk.

278
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,990
I can write down
the names of the criminals...

279
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,492
and slowly reduce
the number of evil people.

280
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,369
What's the point?

281
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:02,416
Any fool can figure it out if someone
is just "eliminating the bad guys."

282
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,086
I want the world to know...
of my existence!

283
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,464
And that there's someone
who is passing judgment onto them!

284
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,138
But...what's the point
in passing judgment?

285
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,639
Why do it?

286
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,643
I was bored. . .too.

287
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,690
Naturally, I didn't believe it at first.

288
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,235
But that Death Note has
the supernatural power...

289
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,613
to tempt people to want
to try it at least once.

290
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,034
<i>I-I killed them...</i>

291
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,288
<i>Two men- - - I killed them!</i>

292
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,709
<i>Human lives. . .
shouldn't be taken so lightly!</i>

293
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,379
<i>Do I have the right to
judge people like that?</i>

294
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,258
No...

295
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,718
<i>I'm not wrong!</i>

296
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,845
<i>I always thought about this...</i>

297
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,722
<i>The world is rotten!</i>

298
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,558
<i>And that rotten people
should die!</i>

299
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,560
<i>Someone...</i>

300
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,188
<i>Someone must do it!</i>

301
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,566
<i>Even if it means sacrificing
one's conscience and life!</i>

302
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,986
<i>Things can't stay. . .like this!</i>

303
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,074
<i>Even if someone else had
picked up the Death Note...</i>

304
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,869
<i>would they be able to erase
unwanted people from this world?</i>

305
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,496
<i>No way!</i>

306
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,249
<i>But I can... I can do it!</i>

307
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,545
<i>In fact, I'm the only one
who can do it!</i>

308
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,924
<i>And I will. ..
with the Death Note!</i>

309
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,718
<i>I'll change the world!</i>

310
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,758
At first, I kept writing the names
of criminals...

311
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,844
like I was cleaning up the world.

312
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,556
So that in time,
no one would do evil.

313
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,935
While those guilty ones who truly
deserved to be punished for their crimes,

314
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,603
die of heart attacks...

315
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:32,107
people who were immoral
or harass others

316
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,776
will slowly be erased through
illness or accidents.

317
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:39,448
Then the world would truly
move in the right direction.

318
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:46,621
And I would create a new world of
earnest, kind humans.

319
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,625
Then you'd be the only one left. ..
with a bad personality.

320
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,253
Huh? What're you saying?

321
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,755
Ryuk...

322
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:59,259
I'm probably the best,
most diligent honor student in Japan.

323
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,971
And I...

324
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,309
will become the god
of this new world!

325
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,230
<i>Humans...</i>

326
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,816
<i>are interesting, after all.</i>

327
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,494
TO BE CONTINUED

328
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,625
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see</i>

329
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:37,047
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

330
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,509
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

331
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:46,014
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

332
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:52,395
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

333
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:57,025
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

334
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:02,697
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

335
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,368
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

336
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,955
<i>To accomplish</i>

337
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:15,418
<i>[deceit] [fear] [vanity] [melancholy]</i>

338
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:20,966
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

339
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,096
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

340
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:31,768
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

341
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,149

342
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,234
KIRA, KILL EVERYONE.

343
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,151
SEND MESSAGE?
SEND

344
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,488
The entire world is watching...

345
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,951
to see what happens
if anyone defies me. . .L.
